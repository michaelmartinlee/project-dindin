# Hands On Project - Gama Academy xp42

>* Gama prepared a challenge to allow you to put into practice much of what has been learned, and what will still be learned, throughout the recorded modules and live classes. The idea is to practice a lot so that the new concepts become more natural, and when the time comes to work on a real product, it feels easy!

>* The fictional company DINDIN wants to launch a content platform about Financial Education, and you have been hired as a developer to create this platform. We already have the layout ready for all the pages, but we need you to develop the site using HTML and CSS.
